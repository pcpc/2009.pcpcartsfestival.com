                  Makoto was born in 1960 in Boston, Massachusetts and educated bi-culturally between the US and Japan.  He received an MFA from Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music.  His new book, River of Grace, traces his journey of mastering Nihonga technique using carefully stone-ground minerals including azurites, malachite and cinnabar, and his deep wrestling with art and faith issues.  In 1992, Makoto was honored as the youngest artist ever to have had a piece acquired by the Museum of Contemporary Art, Tokyo.  In 1990, Makoto founded The International Arts Movement in New York City which has attracted international notable speakers.

              </p>
              <p>As an artist working from his studio near Ground Zero, Makoto was deeply affected by the tragic events of 9/11, but his arts continues to speak hope even in darkness and the deeper consideration of life's meaning.  His works have become part of the collections in the Saint Louis Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art in Tokyo and the Time Warner/AOL/CNN building in Hong King.  Makoto was appointed to the National Council of the Arts in 2003, a six year Presidential appointment.</p>
              <p>Noted artistic critic Robert Kushner wrote, "The idea of forging a new kind of art, about hope, healing, redemption, refuge, while maintaining visual sophistication and intellectual integrity is a growing movement, one which finds Fujimura's work at the vanguard."</p>
