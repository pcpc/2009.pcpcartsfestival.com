            <h2>Registration</h2>
            <p>
              The Art Registration form must be completed and received by
              <strong>noon, February 14, 2009</strong>.
              Registration opens online
              <strong>January 1, 2009</strong>.
              Contact
              <a href="mailto:lawan.andersen@pcpc.org?subject=Arts Festival">Lawan Andersen</a>
              after
              <strong>January 1</strong>
              if you do not have internet access to register
              online. No incomplete entry form will be accepted. A digital image must be
              attached to the registration form to be used for identification purposes only.
              The piece does not have to be completely finished for the registration form but
              must be recognizable in the photo. The artist's statement must also be completed
              and submitted with the registration form.
            </p>
            <h2>Criteria</h2>
            <p>
              Artwork will be juried after delivery to be accepted into the show. Criteria:
              artistic merit and appropriateness to theme as also reflected in the artist's
              statement. Works must score highly in both categories to win.
            </p>
            <h2>Art Delivery Day</h2>
            <p>
              Artwork will be received on
              <em>Art Delivery Day</em>,
              <strong>March 28, 2009</strong>.
              If a work is judged to not fit the theme, PCPC will eliminate it upon
              registration or the day of delivery and the artist can take it home. All the
              delivered work will be juried from
              <strong>March 30 to April 3, 2009</strong>.
              A $25.00 entry fee (cash or check) is required for each artist (or group of
              artists) and will be collected on
              <em>Art Delivery Day</em>.
            </p>
            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              Artists must be 16 years of age or older. Due to space limitations, only two
              entries will be allowed per person or group of artists. A limited number of
              artwork pieces will be chosen for exhibition during the jury process.
            </p>
            <h2>Acceptable Media</h2>
            <p>
              Acceptable media categories are original, handmade works on canvas, water
              media on paper, pastels, drawings, fabric, sculpture, and photography.
              Photography entrants must acknowledge that the work is an original single
              work created solely by the entrant and that no infringement of copyright
              exists. The original unmodified camera image must be submitted. A photograph
              that has elements removed is not eligible. No gicl&eacute;e prints.
            </p>
            <h2>Presentation requirements</h2>
            <p>
              Two-dimensional works must be appropriately framed
              (no clip-framed work is acceptable), ready for wall mounting, and must not
              exceed 42 inches in any direction (including framing). Gallery-wrapped canvas
              with no exposed staples or tacks will be accepted only if it is properly wired
              for hanging and all exposed canvas is painted. Sculpture footprint must
              not exceed 2 feet x 3 feet by 40 inches height. A stand must be provided by
              the artist and fit within the footprint.
            </p>
            <p>
              *The exhibition reserves the right to exclude any entry that exceeds size
              limitations, presents unusual installation problems, cannot be handled by
              exhibit volunteers, is improperly framed, or is damaged upon receipt. No
              unfinished or wet works will be accepted. All works must be received by
              designated delivery date and in time for consideration in the show and
              an award.
            </p>
